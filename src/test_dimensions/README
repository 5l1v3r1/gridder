The test_dimensions folder runs tests with 1-D X, Y, Z and 2-D XY, XZ, YZ. 
All the input file for this test are in input directory, all the output in output directory. 
The output to compare against is in output_examples direcory. 
The result of the diff command is in diff_result directory. 

To test the grid, run the test.scr script.
The script runs through the input files in input directory and outputs the result in output directory. 
Then it checks the differences between the results in output directory and the tested results in 
output_examples directory. Then it records the output of the diff command in diff_result directory and 
lists the diff_result directory content. The files in diff_result directory, i.e., 
listed in the command line should be 0B in size. 

Note: LaGriT can be used to convert the AVS file to GMV for viewing.
See GMV mesh files in the directory output_gmv
To convert AVS to GMV use command: 
   lagrit < avs_to_gmv.lgi
