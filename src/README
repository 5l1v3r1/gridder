/*  This program allows the user to create a simple 2-D or 3-D grid by  */

/*  may be equal(linear), geometric, or logarithmic.  		      	*/
/*									*/
/* For each region on each axis, the user must input the beginning node */  
/* coordinate on the axis being configured, the end node coordinate,    */
/* and the number of divisions the region is to be divided into.   A    */
/* division is the space between two nodes, so the number of divisions  */
/* = number of nodes - 1.  For geometric spacing, the user must also    */
/* input a geometric factor.  The user will be prompted for each of     */
