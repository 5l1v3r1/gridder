April 4 2011 dev demo using java UI for gridder V2
and has not been used or developed in later versions of gridder.

This directory has the java and compiled jar files.
To run the GUI you will need the gridder executable.

The GUI can also call lagrit and gmv if they are on your path.

* Gridder GUI Java Code, written by Michael Cheung at Los Alamos National Laboratory
* Released: March 31st, 2011 (31/03/2011)

* 
* This program provides a Graphical User Interface for using gridder. The program needs to be in the
* same directory as the gridder executables as well as the LaGriT and GMV executables if the user
* intends on using them. Your operating system will automatically be detected, and if you are not
* running Windows, you have the option of launching GMV. You can find out more by simply hovering
* your mouse over various components of the GUI and reading the tool tips.
* 
* The program also checks for errors such as putting letters where a number should be or putting a double
* where an int should be by using try and catch blocks. It also checks for empty text fields, whether
* positive input fields have positive numbers in them, whether the starting coordinates of one segment
* is greater than the previous, and other potential user mistakes. To further minimize mistakes, the GUI
* automatically enables and disables components based on what is relevant. For each dimension tab there is
* a corresponding RegionMatrix object that removes and adds segments and text fields within each segment 
* based on user input.

GUI interface to call gridder: GridderGUI.jar

   The java interface calls gridder with a gridder input file
   that is created with the user interface. There are tool tips
   on the interface. Hoovering the mouse over any item will display
   help on using the interface to create the grid. 

   Additionally (linux only), the interface can be used to call 
   LaGriT to convert an AVS grid file GMV binary format, and display
   the mesh with GMV mesh viewer. User must select AVS format 1. 

   The result are 2 files called grid.inp and input.grid.
   The file grid.inp is the resulting mesh with coordinates
   and element connectivity written in chosen format. In this
   case the format is AVS with coordinates first, elements last.
   The file input.grid records the user choices and can be redirected
   back into gridder to repeat the run and mesh file.

--------------------------------------------------------
Demo 1 Session 
   creates a 1 Dimensional grid with 1 segment
   This segment is from 0 to 10 with 6 points on X axis 
   The Y axis and Z axis have 1 value at 0
   The grid points are connected as 5 line elements
--------------------------------------------------------
File grid.inp in AVS format:

6 5 0 0 0
1      0      0      0
2      2      0      0
3      4      0      0
4      6      0      0
5      8      0      0
6     10      0      0
1   1 line    1   2
2   1 line    2   3
3   1 line    3   4
4   1 line    4   5
5   1 line    5   6


--------------------------------------------------------
Demo 1 Session with GUI interface to write grid.inp 
User entries are in paranthesis
--------------------------------------------------------
% GridderGUI.jar

User selects 1-D Mesh
User selects tab to X Dimension
User enters Begin and End values for this segment
     (0) (10)
User enters number of Divisions for this segment
     (5)
User can select type of spacing, leave as linear

Return to General tab

Select Update All

If your OS is Linux Select "Launch GMV"

Enter File name (test.inp)

Select Launch (Note Errors will appear in Red Box)

Message will report success and test.inp will be written
and look like grid.inp in this Demo 1 example.
If selected GMV will show the grid elements, select
GMV Display / Nodes / Apply to see the node points.

Non GUI Usage:
   gridder (prompt user for values)
   gridder < input.grid  (input file for gridder)

   Command Line prompts will depend on choices made by
   user but will look something like the following display.
   The user entries are placed here in paranthesis.

   The result are 2 files called grid.inp and input.grid.

   The file grid.inp is the resulting mesh with coordinates
   and element connectivity written in chosen format. In this
   case the format is AVS with coordinates first, elements last.
