<P><b>GRIDDER</b> LA-CC-15-082 is a simple interactive grid generation tool for creating orthogonal,
  2D quadralateral or 3D hexahedral grids. Grid spacing can be even, logarithmic,
or geometric.</P>
<P>On the picture, the spacing on the X and Y axis is uniform, on Z axis on the green block geometric with a factor 1.1, on the orange block geometric with a factor 1.6, on the gray block logarithmic contracting, on the maroon block logarithmic expanding.</P>
