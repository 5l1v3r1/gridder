<P>Example 1 is a simple, 10x10 unit 2D grid. The y axis has 10 divisions which
are equally spaced. The x axis also has 10 divisions, but these are logarithmically
spaced, from small divisions to large divisions.</P>

<P>Example 2 is a 6x6 unit 2D grid. The x axis has three regions of spacing.
The first (leftmost) region s 1 unit long and has 5 equally spaced divisions.
The second region is two units long and has 10 divisions logarithmically
spaced from large to small. The third region is 3 units long with 10 divisions
logarithmically spaced from small to large. The y axis also has three regions
of spacing. All of these regions are 2 units long with 10 divisions, geometrically
spaced. The first (bottom) region has a geometric factor of 1.1, the second
has a geometric factor of 1.3, and the third has a geometric factor of 1.6. </P>
<P>The different colors in Example 2 represent different &quot;zones&quot; of spacing.
Zones are created by the overlapping of different regions of different spacing
in different axes. Each zone is automatically labeled with a different material
number when it is outputted in AVS format. The different colors show the
different materials. </P>
