<H1><A NAME="I.Introduction">I. Introduction</A></H1>
<P>Gridder is a simple interactive grid generation tool for creating orthogonal,
structured grids with quadralateral (2D) or hexahedral (3D) shaped elements.
Grid spacing can be even, logarithmic, or geometric. </P>
<P>Gridder can be run interactively or using an input file with the necessary
parameters for the grid. For a quick explanation of the questions asked
by the program in the interactive mode (which also describe the parameters
necessary for the input file), please see the GRIDDER <A HREF="#II.Tutorial">Quick Tutorial</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="I.A.Description">A. Description and Capabilites </A></H2>
<P>Gridder creates orthogonal one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional
grids. Each dimension can have multiple regions, each with different nodal
spacing. This spacing can be equal spacing, geometric spacing, or logarithmic
spacing. The resulting grid can be outputted in AVS (Advanced Visualization
Systems) format or Tracer 3D format. Coordinate and connectivity data are
calculated for AVS, but only coordinate data is calculated for Tracer3D. </P>
<P>As it runs, the code asks the user for input such as number of dimensions,
number of regions in each dimension, coordinates of region borders, number
of divisions in each region, spacing specifications of each region, and
output format. The code can also accept the necessary information from a
file, bypassing the interactive interface. Everytime the interactive interface
is used, the input parameters are saved to a file so that the same grid
can be regenerated from that file.</P>
<H1><A NAME="II.Tutorial">II. Quick Tutorial</A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="II.A.Run">A. To Run Gridder</A></H2>
<P>To run gridder in the interactive mode, type <KBD><B>gridder</B></KBD>, and then answer the questions that follow. To run gridder from an input
file, type<KBD> <B>gridder &lt;<I>input_filename. </I></B></KBD></P>
<H2><A NAME="II.B.Interactive">B. The Interactive Mode. </A></H2>
<P>You can use Gridder to create a grid to your specifications by simply answering
its questions. Following is a quick explanation of some of the questions
it may ask. </P>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.1.Dimensions">Please input an integer number of dimensions for grid.</A></H3>
<P>Gridder can create grids in 1,2, or 3 dimensions. Type 1 for a 1-dimensional
grid, 2 for a 2-dimensional grid, and 3 for a 3-dimensional grid. </P>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.2.NumRegions">Please input an integer number of regions for axis x.</A></H3>
<P>For each axis, gridder can create as many as 50 <A HREF="#III.A.Regions">regions</A>. A region is an area with a given kind of spacing. In <A HREF="examples.html#example1">example 1</A>, there is only one region in the x axis, since there is only one type of
spacing: logarithmic small to large. In <A HREF="examples.html#example2">example 2</A>, the x axis has equal spacing, then it decreases logarithmically from large
to small spaces, then it logarithmically increases. Thus there are three
regions in this axis: the first is equal spacing, the second is logarithmic
large to small, and the third has logarithmic small to large. There is a
different region for every time there is a different kind of spacing. Different
sized spacing also requires a separate region. For example, to have 10 nodes
spaced 1 unit apart and then 10 nodes spaced 2 units apart requires two
separate regions, even though both regions have equal spacing. </P>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.3.BeginCoordinate">Please input coordinate to BEGIN region 1 of axis x.</A></H3>
<P>This is the first (smallest coordinate value) node in the x axis. It will
be the starting point of the first region in the axis. Gridder will not
ask for a beginning coordinate of any other regions in this axis. The end
coordinate of the current region will always be the first coordinate of
the next region. </P>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.4.EndCoordinate">Please input coordinate to END region 1 of axis x.</A></H3>
<P>This is the last (largest coordinate value) node in the first region. It
will also be used as the first coordinate of the next region. </P>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.5.NumDivisions">Please input an integer number of divisions for region 1 of axis x.</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.5.NumDivisions">If you would prefer to specify dx, then input 0 here.</A></H3>
<P>Here you can input the number of divisions in the region. For example, if
you input 10 divisions, the region will have 9 nodes (11 nodes if you count
the first and last nodes). Inputting 1 division will leave the first and
last nodes where they are and add no new nodes. If you input 0 here, the
code will assume that you would prefer to specify the size of a division,
rather than the number of divisions in a region, and it will ask you more
about that later. </P>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.6.Dx">Please input smallest dx.</A></H3>
<H3>dx may be made smaller to divide evenly into region.</H3>
<P>If you chose 0 on the previous question, Gridder will now ask you to input
a value for dx. dx is the size of the smallest division in the region. If
the number you input for this value does not divide evenly into the region,
than Gridder will make it smaller in order to make it divide evenly. </P>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.7.Spacing">Please input spacing for region 1:</A></H3>
<H3>0 = more information about spacing.</H3>
<H3><A HREF="#III.C.Equal">1 = equally spaced nodes.</A></H3>
<H3><A HREF="#III.D.Geometric">2 = geometric spacing of nodes.</A></H3>
<H3><A HREF="#III.E.Logarithmic">3 = logarithmic spacing of nodes, small spacing to large.</A></H3>
<H3><A HREF="#III.E.Logarithmic">4 = logarithmic spacing of nodes, large spacing to small.</A></H3>
<P>This question asks you to specify what kind of spacing you would like for
this region that you have just finished describing. 0 will give you a table
with a little bit more explanation about the spacing. Here you can click
on any of the possibilities to learn more about them. </P>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.8.SubRegions">Subsequent Regions </A></H3>
<P>From here you will be asked to specify the end coordinate, the number of
divisions, and the type of spacing for all of the subsequent regions in
this axis. </P>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.9.SubAxes">Subsequent Axes</A></H3>
<P>Once you finish inputting the data about the x axis, the program will print
the coordinates of the given axis, and then ask for information about the
next axes, depending on how many dimensions you asked for in your grid.
The process for the other axes is the same as for the x axis. </P>
<H3><A NAME="II.B.10.Output">Please specify output:</A></H3>
<H3>1 = Advanced Visualization Systems (AVS) input specifications.</H3>
<H3>2 = Tracer3d coordinate input specifications. </H3>
<P>Gridder can output information in either AVS format or Tracer3d format.
The AVS option gives output as Unstructured Cell Data. It includes all the
connectivity information, as well as the locations of individual nodes.
For two-dimensional grid, the elements are quadrilaterals. For 3-dimensional
grids, the elements are hexahedrals. For 1-dimensional grids, the elements
are lines. </P>
<P>AVS data also contains material data. Each <A HREF="#III.B.Zones">zone</A> of different spacing is given a different material type in AVS. (The material
numbers are chosen at random). A zone is an area with a certain type of
spacing, created by the crossing of different regions in different axes.
In the example figure, each zone is a different color.</P>
<P>Tracer3d formatted data gives only the location of the nodes, with no information
about elements or connectivity. </P>
<P>The output is written to a file called <KBD>grid.inp</KBD>. The parameters of the grid that were inputted in the questions are saved
to a file called <KBD>input.tmp</KBD>. To generate this same grid again without using the interactive mode, copy
the file to another file name and type <KBD><B>gridder &lt;<I>filename</I></B></KBD>. </P>
<H2><A NAME="II.C.NonInteractive">C. The Non-Interactive Mode</A></H2>
<P>Gridder can also be run with an input file that bypasses the questions of
the interactive mode. The input file simply contains the answers to each
of the questions that the interactive mode would have asked. <A HREF="example1.html">Click here</A> to see the file that generated <A HREF="examples.html">example picture 1.</A></P>
<P>All input files require:</P>
<DD>number of dimensions 
<DD>number of regions for x axis 
<DD>begin coordinate for first region 
<DD>end coordinate for first region 
<DD>number of divisions in first region 
<DD>number indicating type of spacing for first region 
<DD>end coordinate, number of divisions, and type of spacing for all subsequent
regions in first axis 
<DD>all of the above information for subsequent axes 
<DD>number indicating desired output format 
<H1><A NAME="III.Definitions">III. Definitions and Examples of Some Terms </A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="III.A.Regions">A. Regions </A></H2>
<P>A region is a section of an axis with a beginning coordinate, an end coordinate,
a number of divisions , and a number that indicates the type of spacing
(equal geometric, logarithmic small to large, or logarithmic large to small).
If any region in an axis has already been defined, the beginning border
of the next region is automatically set equal to the end border of the previous
region. Example 1 shows a set of coordinates on the x-axis with four different
regions of the same size, each with ten divisions. The first consists of
equall spaced nodes; the second of geometrically spaced nodes with a geometric
factor of two; the third of logarithmically spaced nodes, small to large;
and the fourth of logarithmically spaced nodes, large to small. This is
actually a two-dimensional example, where the y-axis has only one region
with one division in order to make the x divisions easier to visualize. 
<IMG SRC="./Images/manual/example1.gif" WIDTH="506" HEIGHT="344" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/tmp_mnt/scratch/mira5/lund/www/Images/manual/example1.gif"> </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="III.B.Zones">B. Zones</A></H2>
<P>When there are multiple regions on two or more axes, the region boundaries
cross, forming areas with a certain type of spacing in the x dimension,
another type of spacing in the y dimension, and (if it is three-dimensional)
another type of spacing in the z dimension. for example, in a two-dimensional
grid, the region boundaries of the y-axis cross the region boundaries of
the x-axis, dividing each region in the x-axis into areas with the same
spacing in the x dimension, but each with a different type of spacing in
the y dimension. These areas are referred to as zones. Example 2a has four
regions on the x-axis, similar to example 1, but now there are two regions
on the y-axis. The first has ten divisions, and the second has twenty divisions.
Both have equally spaced nodes. The resulting cross of region borers creates
eight zones. Example 2b is the same grid as example 2a, but it sohows the
zones separated for easier visualization. </P>
<P>In AVS output, the zone number is used as the naterial number. If the user
defines no properties for these material numbers, AVS will simply show each
zone as a different color. Otherwise, the user can define these material
properties to his or her preference, making each zone have different properties. <IMG SRC="Images/manual/example2a2b.gif" WIDTH="591" HEIGHT="789" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/tmp_mnt/scratch/mira5/lund/www/Images/manual/example2a2b.gif"> </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="III.C.Equal">C. Equal Spacing</A></H2>
<P>The user may pick one of four kinds of nodal spacing for each region. The
simplest of these is referred to as equal spacing. Equal spacing of nodes
simply means that the region is divided equally into the dgiven number of
divisions. Each division is the same length. The <A HREF="#V.A.Equal">formula</A> for calculateing the coordinates of equally spaced nodes can be found in <A HREF="#V.AppendixI">Appendix 1</A>. </P>
<P>Example 3 shows a grid with four regions on the x-axis, each with equal
spacing. The first two zones are both ten units long (last coordinate of
zone munus first coordinate of zone=10) but the first has only three divisions
while the second has seventeen. The third zone is only five units long but
has ten divisions, and the fourth zone is twenty units long and also has
ten divisions. <IMG SRC="Images/manual/example3.gif" WIDTH="494" HEIGHT="348" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/tmp_mnt/scratch/mira5/lund/www/Images/manual/example3.gif"> </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="III.D.Geometric">D. Geomtric Spacing </A></H2>
<P>In a geometrically spaced region, the distance between two consecutive nodes
changes by a factor given by the user. TWhen geometric spacing is chosen,
the user will be prompted for a &quot;geometric factor&quot; that determines this
rate of change. For example, with a geometric factor of two, the largest
division is twice the length of the previous division, which is twice the
length of the division before that, etc. The coordinates become members
of a geometric series. The <A HREF="#V.B.Geometric">actual formulas</A> used to calculate the coordinates in a geometrically spaced series can
be found in <A HREF="#V.AppendixI">Appendix 1.</A> </P>
<P>Example 4 shows some sample geometrically spaced regions. Each region is
ten units long and has 10 divisions. The first has a geometric factor of
1.2, the second has a factor of 4, the third ahs a factor of 1.6, and the
fourth has a factor of 0.625. If a user wants the distance between nodes
to shrink by a given factor as opposed to growing by that factor, he or
she can simply input the value of 1 divided by that factor (1/f) when prompted
for a geometric factor. Zones 3 and 4 in Example 4 demonstrate this relationship.
Zone 3 has a geometric factor of 1.6, and zone 4 has a geometric factor
of 0.625 = 1/1.6. They have the same rate of change of distance between
nodes, but in opposite directions (distances in zone 3 are growing from
left to right while distances in zone 3 are shrinking from left to right. </P>
<P>A geometric factor of 1 would result in the equivalent of equal spacing. </P>
<P>Also notice that the smallest divisions becomes very small before the geometric
factor gets very large at all. As this length decreses, accuracy decreases.
I therefore recommend avoidance of large geometric factors as well as avoidance
of very large numbers of divisions within a small region.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Images/manual/example4.gif" WIDTH="561" HEIGHT="376" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/tmp_mnt/scratch/mira5/lund/www/Images/manual/example4.gif"></P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="III.E.Logarithmic">E. Logarithmic Spacing </A></H2>
<P>In a region with logarithmic spacing, coordinates of nodes are determined
as a function of a base 10 logarithm. Since by nature, logarithmic spacing
results in smaller divisions growing to larger divisions as we move from
left to right across the region, I have included a separate type of spacing
that allws the user to assign &quot;backwards&quot; logarithmic spacing, where, from
left to right, the divisions are larger and become smaller. <A HREF="#V.C.Logarithmic">Details</A> of how logarithmic spacing is calculated can be found in <A HREF="#V.AppendixI">Appendix 1</A>. </P>
<P>Example 5 shows some sample regions with logarithmic spacing. There are
4 regions on the x-axis, each 10 units long. The first two have 5 divisions
each, the first with spacing of small divisions to large and the second
with large to small, and the last two have 30 divisions each, the third
with small divisions to large and the fourth with large to small. <IMG SRC="Images/manual/example5.gif" WIDTH="536" HEIGHT="377" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/tmp_mnt/scratch/mira5/lund/www/Images/manual/example5.gif"></P>
<P></P>
<H1><A NAME="IV.Limitations">IV. Limitations </A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="IV.A.Dimensions">A. Dimensions </A></H2>
<P>This program can generate 1, 2, or 3 dimensional grids, but a 2-dimensional
grid will use only the x- and y-axes, and a 1-dimensional grid will use
only the x-axis. </P>
<H2><A NAME="IV.B.Limited">B. Limited Number of Nodes and Regions</A></H2>
<P>As the program standds now, there can be no more than 200 nodes in any one
axis, and no more than 50 regions. If desired, these limits can be easily
changed in the source code. They are constants that are defined at the beginning
of the code called MAXNODES and MAXZONES. </P>
<H2><A NAME="IV.C.Accuracy">C. Accuracy</A></H2>
<P>Coordinates are given with accuracy up to 6 significant digits. If the number
of divisions becomes very large with respect to the size of the regionk,
or if the geometric factor of a region with geometric spacing gets too large,
the smallest divisions can become too small with respect to the other divisions
in the grid, and accuracy decays. No more than 6 decimal digits difference
in length of divisions can be calculated. I recommend avoidance of these
practices that may result in verry small sized divisions. </P>
<P></P>
<H2>Happy Gridding! </H2>
<P></P>
<H1><A NAME="V.AppendixI">V. Appendix I</A></H1>
<P>This appendix gives the formulas use to calculate the different kinds of
spacing available from this grid generator, including equal spacing, geometric
spacing, and logarithmic spacing. For all of the formulas given in this
appendix, the following conventions will be used: </P>
<P><B>dx </B>is the distance between first two consecutive nodes in region </P>
<P><B>n1 </B>is the first coordinate in the region (This is inputted by the user for
the first region. For all subsequent regions, n1 is set equal to the last
coordinate of the previous region. </P>
<P><B>n2 </B>is the second coordinate in the region, etc..</P>
<P><B>nx </B>is the last corrdinate in the region,</P>
<P><B>d </B>is the number of divisions in the region </P>
<P><B>x </B>is the total number of coordinates in region = d + 1. </P>
<P><B>f </B>is the geometric factor. </P>
<P><B>L </B>is the length of the region. </P>
<P><B>px </B>is the percentage associated with node nx.</P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="V.A.Equal">A. Equal Spacing </A></H2>
<P>Equal spacing of nodes is calculated according to the following formula: </P>
<DD>dx = (nx -n1)/d 
<DD>n2=n1+dx 
<DD>n3=n1_2dx... 
<DD>nx=n1+x*d 
<P>If the region being configured is the first region of the axis, n1 is inputted
as the &quot;beginning coordinate of the region&quot; by the user. Ptherwise, n1 is
the same coordinate that ended the previous region. The program does not
duplicate this coordinate as a separate node in the axis. </P>
<H2><A NAME="V.B.Geometric">B. Geometric Spacing </A></H2>
<P>Geometric spacing is calculated according to the following formula:</P>
<DD>dx = (nx-n1)/f^0 + f^1 + f^2 ... + f^(d-1) 
<DD>n2 = n1 + (f^0 * dx) 
<DD>n3 = n2 + (f^1 * dx), etc... 
<H2><A NAME="V.C.Logarithmic">C. Logarithmic Spacing </A></H2>
<P>To achieve logarithmic spacing, all cases are determined with respect to
an analogous region starting at 1 and ending at 10. The code divides this
temporary region equally into the given number of divisions, takes the logarighm
of each of those numbers, and treats the resulting numbers as percentages
of the size of the actual region. That is the reason for choosing the region
from 1 to 10: log(1) = 0, and log(10) = 1. Therefore, the first coordinate
of the region is placed at 0% of the way across the actual region (at the
beginning), and the last node is placed at 100% of the way across the region
(at the end). Let's consider the simplest example: </P>
<P>Let's say the user actually wants a region that starts at 1 and ends at
10, so we need no analogous region., Let's also say the he or she wants
9 divisions. The code divides the region into 9 equally spaced divisions,
giving us the coordinates 1, 2, 3, 4 .... 10. It then takes the log of each
of these numbers, giving us the following percentages: (the code actually
calculates the logarithms to 6 decimal points precision)</P>
<P>log(1) = 0% log(2) = 0.310 = 30.1% log(3) = 0.477 = 47.7% log(4) = 0.602
= 60.2% ... log(10) = 1 = 100% We now calculate the actual coordinates of
the nodes by the following formula: nx = n1 + (px * L)</P>
<P>So for example, </P>
<DL>
<DT>n1 = n1 + (p1 * L) = 1 + (0% * 9) = 1 
<DD>
<DT>n2 = n1 + (p2 * L) = 1 + (30.1% * 9) = 3.709 
<DT>n3 = n1 + (p3 * L) = 1 + (47.7% * 9) = 5.29 , ...etc. 
<DT>n10 = 1 + (p10 * L) = 1 + (100% * 9) = 10 
</DL>
<P>The formula for logarithmic spacing, large to small, is similar: nx = n1
- (px*L), where n1 in this case is the last coordinate of the region, the
end border. </P>
<P>Even if the example above had not begun at 1 and ended at 10, we would have
followed the same procedure, dividing a region from 1 to 10 into the number
of divisions given by the user, taking the logs of those numbers, and using
them as percentage distances across the region. </P>
